  <p>Recently whenever I'm bored, tired and with just 20 minutes to spare (bored enough so I can't go to sleep early but too tired to do anything productive, and turning on the console for <em>just 20 minutes</em> never works) I got onto the habit of browsing clothes, cosmetics, etc. Maybe I need to fill in some void, or maybe I've been succumbing again to the pressure of looking <em>presentable</em> when going to the office (after several months of remote work spent in some jeans and nondescript t-shirts). Either way, there's clearly a pattern here.</p>
<p>So I gathered the websites I've been using too frequently for no good reason, and added them to <code>/etc/hosts</code>. After a while, I decided to impose that ban on some other sites that seem to bring no value to me. Currently the selection is as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># Block super stupid sites I don&#39;t want to waste my time on
0.0.0.0 www.reserved.com
0.0.0.0 reserved.com

0.0.0.0 twitter.com
0.0.0.0 www.twitter.com
0.0.0.0 instagram.com
0.0.0.0 www.instagram.com
</pre></div>


<p>I don't even have accounts on twitter and instagram anymore so why was I browsing them? Muscle memory, I think.</p>
<p>Remember to restart the browser (and flush the dns beforehand, preferably) after each change. On Ubuntu 18.04, it's possible to flush dns with <code>sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches</code>.</p>
<p>Now what will I do with all that extra time? Perhaps I should order more books :)</p>
