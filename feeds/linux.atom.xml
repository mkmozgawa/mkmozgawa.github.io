Either way, there's clearly a pattern here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I gathered the websites I've been using too frequently for no good reason, and added them to &lt;code&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt;. After a while, I decided to impose that ban on some other sites that seem to bring no value to me. Currently the selection is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;# Block super stupid sites I don&amp;#39;t want to waste my time on

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't even have accounts on twitter and instagram anymore so why was I browsing them? Muscle memory, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember to restart the browser (and flush the dns beforehand, preferably) after each change. On Ubuntu 18.04, it's possible to flush dns with &lt;code&gt;sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now what will I do with all that extra time? Perhaps I should order more books :)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="linux"></category><category term="lifehacks"></category></entry></feed>
