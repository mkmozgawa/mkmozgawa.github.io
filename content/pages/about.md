Summary: About me
Url: about.html
Save_as: about.html

This blog serves mostly as a reference guide for me; when I learn something new, I usually write it down in case I forget it. Sometimes some of that knowledge might end up here :)

I work as a QA at [Cognifide](https://www.cognifide.com). My professional interests revolve mostly around software development and data analysis.

Others things I enjoy: linguistics, astrophysics, RPGs, well-made food, and dank memes. 

I also co-organize [Rails Girls Poznan](http://www.railsgirls.com/poznan) and will gladly support any other diversity-oriented non-profits.

If you have an [interesting book to recommend](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90496754-magda), the best way to contact me is via [email](mailto:hello@magda.space).

This page has been created using [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/index.html); its source code (and other silly projects of mine) are available [here](https://github.com/mkmozgawa).
