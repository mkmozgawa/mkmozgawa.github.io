What am I up to, these days?

1. Learning about machine learning, especially Natural Language Processing and computer vision. The topics I find especially interesting are, in no particular order, plagiarism detection, readability, character recognition, human-computer interaction.
2. Working on my engineering degree project (which uses 1. in some ways).
3. Working as a QA at [Cognifide](https://www.cognifide.com).
4. Giving back to the community, be it by co-organizing the [Rails Girls Poznan](http://www.railsgirls.com/poznan) workshops, preparing some extra classes on the English pronunciation for my fellow students, or just running around and explaining things to people in general.
5. Reading [as much as I have time for](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90496754-magda) which never feels enough.
6. Writing this blog -- it serves mostly as a reference guide for me but if you ever find it useful (or see something blatantly wrong) [let me know](mailto:hello@magda.space).
7. Cooking, with the emphasis on vegetarian/vegan dishes (though I'm not a real vegetarian/vegan these days).
8. Browsing and creating dank memes. :)
9. Playing RPGs, tabletop games, and video games.
